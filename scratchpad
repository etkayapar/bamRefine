If the only SNP is a faulty SNP:
    then discard the read
else:
    mask (put N) the faulty SNP

use pileup:
    find reads that contain faulty snps. copy the reads into a hash
    or alignment object. Mask the faulty position. 

then:
    read the bam file line by line. Write them into the new file. If the
    read is in faultyReads, write the masked one instead to the file.
