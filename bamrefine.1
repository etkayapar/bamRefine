.SH NAME
bamrefine \- Mask SNPs from a BAM file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB bamrefine \fP [OPTIONS][-vt] <in.bam> <out.bam>
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbamrefine\fP processes a BAM file to mask the positions from an
alignment if that read carries a variant position that could be affected
by post-mortem damage (PMD). e.g. If a read carries a C/* position at its
5' end or it carries a G/* position at its 3' end. The regions treated as 5'
or 3' "end" is not pre-defined and should be provided to the program with its
argument (see \fB-l\fP)
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-s, --snps\fP
Path to BED or SNP formatted file for SNP positions and reference and
alternative alleles.
.TP
\fB-p, --threads\fP
Number of threads to run the program in parallel.
.TP
\fB-g, --ref-genome \fP
Path to genome .fasta for the program to fetch the chromosome
names from.
.TP
\fB-l, --pmd-length-threshold\fP
PMD length threshold. Positions that are up to and including this far in any read
will be evaluated and masked. There is no one-for-all default value that can be set,
so it is highly recommended that you have a prior information about the PMD profiles of your
libraries before you run \fBbamrefine\fP
.SS FLAGS
.TP
\fB-v, --verbose\fP
Verbose output of progress
.TP
\fB-t, --add-tags\fP
Add tags to output BAM file related to masking statistics using
optional fields in alignment records. e.g. ZC:Z:2,1 ZP:Z:0,5;68
would mean that program masked 2 5' and 1 3' positions and they were at index 0,5 and 68 in the sequence.
.TP
\fB-k, --keep-tmp\fP
Don't remove the temprorary run directory. It will include intermediate BAM files, cached SNPs, etc.
this directory is under current working directory named as \fB.tmp_bamrefine\fP
.TP
\fB-h, --help\fP
display a short help message inplace
